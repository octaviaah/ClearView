| [ ] | **Confidentiality** | Protecting the personal data of candidates is crucial for ensuring candidate privacy and preventing biases and maintaining trust in the hiring process, making sure personal information is not disclosed  in the final anonymized resume. This is accomplished by restricting access to personal data of a candidate and authorizing access to personal information only to companies that decided to move forward with a candidate and after the company paid for unlocking the full resume. | 
| [ ] | **Observability** | Essential from multiple perspectives, this can be enforced by adding metrics and reports in the system : <br> - by monitoring the resume re-construction process, it can be determined if the resumes include any potential biases to ensure proper anonymization and that the personal data is not leaked until the company pays for the full resume. The anonymized resumes that include possible biases or personal information can be flagged to then be reviewed by an administrator.  <br>- by monitoring the performance it can be determined if the system is scaling correctly as the volume of resumes increases<br>- security monitoring will track the actions performed on the system, to make sure there are no unauthorized users to access the personal information of candidates. |
| [ X ] | **Cost-efficiency** | By balancing the infrastructure and the operational expenses, optimizing resources and automating processes can result in a significant cost reduction over time, while ensuring the system remains efficient. By using events, AI -based processes like anonymization will allow the system to provision compute resources only when needed, reducing the costs during low-activity periods. By scaling on demand, the system will automatically provision additional resources. Storage costs can be optimized by establishing data retention policies and storing only frequently accessed data in low latency storage. |
| [ ] | **Data integrity and consistency** | To ensure the system processes and handles data accurately, the system has input and post-process validations. Storing the initial data submitted by the candidate will make sure the data is not lost during the process. By monitoring the processes it can be determined if the data was corrupted or lost. Using event sourcing will help the system  |
| [ ] | **Performance and scalability** | The system can provide timely and effective results while maintaining responsiveness by using asynchronous and batch processing to handle multiple resumes at the same time. The system can automatically provision additional resources when necessary using auto-scaling, ensuring a constant performance. Using asynchronous retries for failed events and dead letter queues for events that can't be processed after several attempts can prevent stalled attempts and bottlenecks. Scalability ensures the systems can adapt to increased demand by implementing auto-scaling policies to adjust the resource allocation based on real time demand. Using an event queue management can handle incoming events efficiently. Areas that need scaling can be identified by monitoring the performance.|
| [ X ] | **Elasticity** | To ensure the need of both companies and candidates are met, the system needs to consider the dynamic resource allocation and asynchronous processing. |
| [ X ] | **Agility** | In order to be able to respond to potential new requirements from companies, the system is setup to use CI/CD pipelines to release the improvements in small, incremental updates. Short period cycles which put the emphasis on small incremental changes followed by continuous feedback loops  |

## Other characteristics taken into consideration
* **AI responsibility** : Since the AI component is directly handling sensitive information, its design need to align with key principles related to **data privacy**, **fairness**, **transparency** and **inclusiveness**. 
    * While working with personal information of candidates, the system uses the least privilege principle in order to make sure the data is protected. The GenAI processes the data required for anonymization and the resume uploaded by candidates in order to generate useful tips and discards any non-essential information to reduce the risk of data breaches. 
    * The AI system should treat every resume the same, generating the same tips, same anonymized resumes and same matches for similar resumes. 
    
## Implicit characteristics

* **feasibility** - The system was designed based on constraints like cost and security and it's need for change.
* **maintainability** - by using loose coupled modular components, we allow independent updates and modifications to individual modules, without affecting the whole system. By using CI/CD pipelines to release small, incremental features, we ensure version control, making sure the changes could be reverted if needed.
* **security** - ensured by implementing access control and minimizing the data users have access to. The access to personal information is limited by using a separate database.
