# ClearView

## Summary
This repository presents an architectural proposal done by the Dreamers League team for the O'Reilly Fall 2024 Architectural Katas contest. This proposal describes our approach in implementing the ClearView, a piece of software that is intended to be integrated with HR systems, to simplify the hiring process and assure a more inclusive viewpoint. We have made a thorough analysis of the requirements, came up with arguments to support the architectural characteristics we found, concentrated on designing diagrams(sequence, C4) and identified the user flows exposed through ClearView. All these elements complete our vision on how we want ClearView to be designed and implemented.
